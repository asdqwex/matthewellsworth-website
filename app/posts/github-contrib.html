Today I realized that all the commits I do at work don't show up on my public github page... <br><br>

Compare these two screen shots. The first is when I am logged in. Feeling good about how much code I have written.<br>

The second is what everyone who visits my page sees...<br>

500 vs 100. That probably doesn't impress many people.<br>
I will have to make sure to contribute to a public repo everyday.
