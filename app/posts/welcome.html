Welcome! <br><br>

My name is Matthew Ellsworth and I have been a Professional Systems Engineer, Linux Hobbyist and Web Developer for almost a decade.<br><br>

I grew up with the internet and love playing video games, traveling(never get to do this enough) and writing code.<br><br>

About this site, I stole most of the code. Like any good Linux admin. <br><br>

Thanks to Seandon Mooy @ <a href="erulabs.com">erulabs.com</a> for the web design and code. <a href="https://github.com/erulabs/erulabs.com.git"> Source </a> <br><br>

Forked, mangled and pushed to production as matthewellsworth.com. <br><br>

I have to say it was a very quick and painless process. Just: <br><br>

<pre>
  <code class="language-bash">
npm install\n
gulp watch
  </code>
</pre><br>

Then I made some minor changes. Like using my on name, adding posts and changing the background pattern.<br><br>

And now I have my own blog to post on.
