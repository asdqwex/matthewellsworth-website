Hello again,<br><br>

I found myself in need of a demo rails application the other day and decided to write a copy pasteable how to on setting up a very minimal rails applicaiton.<br><br>

Why? Good Question.<br><br>

I assume you already have Ruby installed on you computer and from there you can proceed as follows:<br>

<pre>
  <code class="language-bash">
gem install rails\n
rails new demo\n
cd demo\n
bin/rails server
  </code>
</pre><br>
Now point your browser at <a href="http://localhost:3000">http://localhost:3000</a><br><br>

Lets see if this works.<br><br>

From there create a git repo and push it to github so you can check it out whenever you need to test.<br>

<pre>
  <code class="language-bash">
git init\n
git add .\n
git commit -m 'First commit'\n
git remote add origin remote https://github.com/asdqwex/rails-demo\n
git push origin master
  </code>
</pre><br>

Now you should have something like this: <a href="https://github.com/asdqwex/rails-demo">https://github.com/asdqwex/rails-demo</a>
